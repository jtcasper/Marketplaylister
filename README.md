# Marketplaylister

This app automatically creates a Spotify playlist from the Marketplace with Kai Ryssdal music from the month's podcasts.

# Usage

- Have the secrets in a `secrets.php` file handy ;)
- Run a server that can handle php files on `localhost:7777`.
- Navigate to `localhost:7777/marketplay.php?state=MM:YYYY` (because I did an ugly hack for now) and authorize access to create public and private playlists.
- Listen!
